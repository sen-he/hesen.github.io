**Testing cloud elasticity for Serverless Cloud**
Cloud computing is growing in popularity due to rapid provisioning, easy scalability, and pay-as-you-go pricing model. Performance testing on cloud platforms is difficult due to resource contention, cloud providers’ hidden scheduling policies, and passive auto-scaling policies. Additionally, performance testing is more difficult on serverless clouds as the resource abstract level is higher than IaaS clouds’, and auto-scaling stages for serverless clouds are not yet well defined. Our first research goal is to define auto-scaling stages for serverless clouds and develop performance testing methodologies for each auto-scaling stages. The performance uncertainties of serverless cloud are from resource contention during the application execution part and random cold start-up latencies during the environment initiation part. Based on the observations, our second research goal is to develop a new Monte-Carlo-Simulation-based testing methodology to simulate and predict the performance distribution of serverless applications.

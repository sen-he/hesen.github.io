---

I'm currently an assistant professor of Computer Science at Augusta University. I got my PhD from University of Texas at San Antonio in 2022.

My research interests include the areas of cloud computing, software engineering, Performence Engineering, and the applications of Artificial Intelligence. 

I'm currently looking for self-motivated student to work on my projects.
